# AI Integration in Boop

Boop includes AI capabilities to enhance your task management experience. This guide explains how to set up and use the AI features.

## Setting Up AI

To configure your AI provider:

```bash
boop ai
```

This interactive command will guide you through:

1. Selecting an AI provider (currently supports OpenAI)
2. Entering your API key
3. Configuring additional settings if needed

## What Can AI Do in Boop?

The AI integration in Boop can help with several aspects of task management:

### Task Analysis

- Analyze your task patterns
- Identify potential bottlenecks in your workflow
- Suggest task prioritization based on your completion history

### Natural Language Processing

- Create tasks using natural language
- Extract due dates, priorities, and projects from your descriptions
- Understand context and categorize tasks appropriately

### Productivity Insights

- Generate reports on your productivity trends
- Provide suggestions for improving your task management
- Identify optimal times for different types of tasks

## Example AI Usage

Here are some examples of how to leverage the AI features:

```bash
# Create a task with natural language processing
boop create "Schedule team meeting for next Tuesday at 2pm with high priority"

# Get AI-powered insights on your completed tasks
boop summary --weeks 2 --ai-analysis

# Let AI suggest task prioritization
boop list --ai-prioritize
```

## Privacy Considerations

When using AI features:

- Your task data is sent to the configured AI provider
- API keys are stored securely on your local machine
- No data is permanently stored on external servers beyond what's needed for processing

You can disable AI features at any time by running:

```bash
boop ai --disable
```

## Supported AI Models

Currently, Boop supports:

- OpenAI GPT models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4)
- More providers will be added in future updates

## Troubleshooting AI Features

If you encounter issues with AI features:

1. Verify your API key is correct:
   ```bash
   boop ai --verify
   ```

2. Check your API usage limits with your provider

3. Ensure you have a stable internet connection

4. Try updating to the latest version of Boop:
   ```bash
   # For Unix-like systems
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kshehadeh/boop/main/install.sh | bash
   
   # For Windows
   # Run the PowerShell installation script again
   ```

The AI features in Boop are continuously improving. Check for updates regularly to access new capabilities.
